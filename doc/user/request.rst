The Observing Request
=====================

The observing request is the part of the proposal
where you specify how much time, in what conditions
and with which instrument,
you expect to need to fulfill the aims of your proposal.

You may wish to return to the observing request later on
in the process once you have used
the Integration Time Calculators to help you determine the
amount of time needed for your observations.

You can go to the observing request page using the
"Edit observing request" link on the proposal page.
The page shows a table with one row for each combination
of instrument and weather band you would like to use.
You can use the "Add request" button to add more rows
to the table and the "Delete" buttons to remove existing
rows.
Note however that any changes you make on this page
are not saved to your proposal until you press the "Save" button.
Also note that each combination of instrument and
weather band should not be entered more than once.

Finally select any special requirements of your
proposal, such as daytime observing.
