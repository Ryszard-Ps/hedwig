Forgotten Password or User Name
===============================

If you forget your user name or password,
please use the "reset your password"
link on the "Log in" page.

On the next page,
enter your user name, email address or both.
If you enter an email address, your password
reset code will be sent to that address.
Otherwise it will be sent to your primary address.

Once you receive the reset code,
you can enter it and select a new password.
After doing this, you will be taken back to the
"Log in" page where your user name will have
been filled in for you in case it also was forgotten.
