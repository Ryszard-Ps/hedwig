Accepting an Invitation
=======================

If someone adds you to their proposal, you may receive
an invitation code by email.
This code can be used in two ways:

* If you do not already have an account, you can register for a new
  account, making use of the information already entered for you.

* Otherwise, you will be able to add the
  new proposal to your existing account.

You may begin by using the link in the invitation email,
or by clicking the "Enter an invitation code" link on the home page.
Copy and paste the code into the box and
press the "Enter code" button.

Next, if you are not already logged in, you will be prompted
to log in or register for an account.
If you do not yet have an account, click the "register" link.
You will only be required to complete the first step,
choosing a user name and password,
as most of the necessary information will already have
been entered by the person who invited you to their proposal.

Then you will see a page giving the details of the invitation
you have received.
Don't worry if the details aren't quite right --- you will be
able to edit your profile after accepting the invitation.
Press the "Accept invitation" button to continue.

The next page you see will depend on the details of the
invitation you received:

* If the person who invited you did not enter your institution,
  you will be asked to select it now.

* Otherwise you should be taken directly to the proposal view page.

* If the system can not determine which proposal to show you,
  you will be redirected to your personal dashboard.
  This will list all the proposals of which you are a member.
