The Title and Abstract
======================

You can edit the title of your proposal using the
"Edit title" link at the top of the proposal main page.

You can also edit the abstract,
using the "Edit abstract and categories" link in the
"Abstract" section of the proposal.

This page also offers a list of categories which you can assign
to your proposal.
Please select any which are appropriate,
as this will help the Time Allocation Committee
to organize the review process for your proposal.

Next to the "Save" button you will find an estimated count of the
number of words in the abstract.
Be sure to keep the abstract within the specified limit,
but note that the estimated counter may not agree with the
actual word count performed by the server when you save the abstract.
So if the counter indicates that the word count is acceptable
but on saving the abstract you see an error "Abstract is too long",
please ignore the estimated count and remove a few words from
your abstract.
