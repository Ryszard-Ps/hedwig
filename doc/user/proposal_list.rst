Your Proposal List
==================

Your proposal list contains all the proposals of
which you are a member.
You can use the list to navigate back to proposals
which you are preparing,
as well as using it to view proposals you have
previously submitted through this system.

To visit your proposals, click the "Your proposals" link
in the menu bar at the top of any page.
If you are not already logged in, you will be prompted
to enter your user name and password before
being taken to the list.
