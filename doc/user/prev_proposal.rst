Previous Proposals
==================

This section of the proposal asks for information about proposals
which you have previously had accepted.

Please enter the proposal identifiers of your previous proposals
in the column at the left.
You can use the "Add previous proposal" button to add as many
rows to the table as necessary.
If your current proposal is a continuation of one of your
previous proposals, you can indicate this by ticking the
"Continuation?" box.

Finally the "Publications" column gives you the opportunity
to list up to six publications related to each of your previous
proposals.
You can either enter the reference manually,
leaving the type selection set to the default --- "Text description" ---
or you can enter an DOI or an arXiv or ADS code by changing the
type selection to the appropriate type and entering the
publication's code in the box.
The system will attempt to look up references entered as codes
after you save the list.
There may be a delay while this happens, during which you may
continue working on your proposal as normal.
