The Completed Proposal
======================

Your completed proposal should end up looking something
like the example below.
(But of course with a lot more detail filled in!)

Things to check include:

* The **proposal status** in the table at the top of the page:
  this should now show **"Submitted"**.
* There should be **no red boxes** (indicating warnings)
  and ideally no yellow boxes (indicating missing sections).

Saving as a PDF File
--------------------

Note that there is not (yet) a way to download a PDF file of your
whole proposal.
In the meantime, many systems offer the ability to print to a PDF file.
Printing the proposal view page should produce a sensible version
of the proposal (without the menu bar and navigation links),
so you should be able to use this to save a copy of the proposal
from your web browser.

* Using **Google Chrome**

  With recent versions of Chrome, on the "Google Cloud Print"
  panel, you can click "Change" in the "Destination" section.
  Then select "Save as PDF".

* With **Linux** systems

  Assuming your system uses CUPS,
  you should be able to print to PDF but you
  may need to add the "CUPS PDF Printer" first.
  You can do this via the CUPS web interface ("Add Printer" button)
  or through the settings application.
  You may first need to install the corresponding software package
  --- this may be called "cups-pdf" or "printer-driver-cups-pdf"
  depending on your Linux distribution.

* With **Mac OS X**

  There is normally an option to save as PDF in the lower left corner
  of the print dialog box.

* With **Windows 10**

  You should be able to save a PDF file by
  selecting "Microsoft Print to PDF" as your printer.
