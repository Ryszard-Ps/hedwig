Creating a Call for Proposals
=============================

When you have prepared a semester and queue, you can combine them
to open a call for proposals.

Select the semster and queue at the top of the page and enter
the range of dates when you want the call for proposals to be
available.  If the opening date is in the future, then the call
will be hidden until that date.

This page also allows you to configure the word, figure and page limits
for various parts of the proposal.
If, for a given part, both a word limit and a PDF page limit are
specified, proposal authors will have the choice of either
entering text on-line or uploading a PDF file.
If one of the limits is set to zero, only the other choice
will be available.

The "technical case note" and "science case note" will be shown
on the page where people will edit the corresponding part of their
proposal.  Therefore you can use these notes to indicate what is
expected in each part.  You may wish to include:

* Elements you wish people to include in their proposal.

* Additional constraints, such as the number of pages of text and
  figures when PDF files are uploaded.

The "Calls" page will then show a table of calls,
indicating the status of each and giving links to
pages about the call.
The "View call" link takes you to the administrative
interface for the call itself.
From here you can edit the call or go to the list of proposals.
The "View proposals" link takes you directly to the list
of proposals for the call.

which is has been created for this call.
