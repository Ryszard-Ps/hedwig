Affiliation Weights
===================

From the "Review process" page, you can use the "Edit affiliation weights"
link to view this page.
It allows you to enter a relative weighting for each of the
affiliations associated with the corresponding call for proposals.
These values will be used in the calculation of the fractional
affiliation of each proposal.
