Sending Feedback
================

Once the committee reviewers have entered feedback for each proposal,
you will be able to use this page to approve these feedback reports.
When you do this, the system will be able to send a feedback message
to the proposal members.
Once the feedback message has been sent, the proposal will
be set to its final "Accepted" or "Rejected" state.
Members of the proposal will be able to log into the system,
see the proposal status and read the feedback online.
